If you're using a [multi-autocomplete form filter](/examples/interaction_filter_multi_autocomplete) and you'd like to filter its results (e.g. only show users from a specific organization in the autocomplete results), you can do so using either or both of the following methods:

* [Autocomplete results configuration](/subcategories/autocomplete) - This allows you to modify autocomplete results across all reports.
* [Contextual filters](/examples/contextual_filters_in_multi_autocompletes) - This allows you to modify autocomplete results for specific reports using context filters.
