When using a `data_method`, you can add form filters by specifying `ui_filters` in the YAML and passing a block to `render_report`, as shown in the example below.

If you use a `multi_autocomplete` filter in the view, you'll need to define the `autocomplete_method` for that filter in the `ui_filters` hash, as shown below.

To learn more about using form filters, see [Form Filters](/examples/interaction_filters_overview).
